## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to represent intellect, focus, and depth of knowledge.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E8EAF6), a desaturated variant of indigo to establish a calm and clean interface.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#00BCD4), to complement indigo and indicate interactivity. Use for highlights, buttons and links to provide clear visual cues.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, techy feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), used for the bulk of the content to ensure readability and accessibility.
- Use clean and modern icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different functions.
- A clean, card-based layout provides the user a well-defined information hierarchy in a small display area. A narrow chat column facilitates readability.
